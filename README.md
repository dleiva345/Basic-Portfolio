   * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `reset.css`, and include the code found from the Meyerweb reset located [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css).
     * In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image, the placeholder images for the portfolio, and the social icon images).

4. Push the above changes to GitHub. 

   * Make sure to `git add .` and `git commit -m "initial site files"`. Then type `git push origin master` to push your changes to your GitHub repo.
